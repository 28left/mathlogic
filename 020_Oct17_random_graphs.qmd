# Fraïssé Theory of Random Graphs

## Key facts from Fräissé theory
To simplify things, we state everything in the context of a **finite language that contains only constants and relations**. In this case *finitely generated* is equivalent to *finite*.

- $\mathcal{M}$ is **homogeneous** if any isomorphism between finite substructures of $\mathcal{M}$ can be extended to an automorphism of $\mathcal{M}$.
- $\mathrm{age}(\mathcal{M})$ is the class of all finite $\mathcal{L}$-structures isomorphic to a substructure of $\mathcal{M}$.
- Any two countable homogeneous structures with the same age are isomorphic.
- A class of finite structures $\overline{K}$ is an **amalgamation class** if it satisfies (HP), (JEP), and (AP). In words, every substructure of a structure in $\overline{K}$ is in $\overline{K}$, any two structures in $\overline{K}$ embed into another structure from $\overline{K}$, and any two structures with a common substructure (up to isomorphism) amalgamate to another structure that preserves the common substructure.
- **Fraïssé's theorem:** Suppose $\overline{K}$ is a class of finite $\mathcal{L}$-structures such that there are only countably many isomorphism types in $\overline{K}$.
Then $\overline{K}$ is an amalgamation class iff $\overline{K}$ is the age of a countable homogeneous $\mathcal{L}$-structure.


## Simple graphs

We consider the theory of *undirected graphs without self-loops*, also called **simple graphs**. Let $\mathcal{L}_G = \{E\}$ be the language of graphs with one binary relation symbol $E$.

Simple graphs are formalized by the axioms

- $\forall x \neg E(x,x)$
- $\forall x, y \: (E(x,y) \to E(y,x))$

We denote the theory of simple graphs by $T_{G}$

::: {#exr-}
Verify that 
$$
\overline{K} = \{\mathcal{G} : \mathcal{G} \models T_G, \mathcal{G} \text{ finite}\}
$$
is an amalgamation class with countably many isomorphism types.
:::

It follows that $\overline{K}$ has a Fraïssé limit. What does this limit look like?

## Random graphs

We add the following **extension axioms**:

$$
\sigma_{n,m} \equiv \forall x_1, \dots, x_n \forall y_1, \dots, y_m \; \left ( \bigwedge_{i=1}^n \bigwedge_{j = 1}^m x_i \neq y_j \; \to \; \exists z \: \bigl ( \bigwedge_{i=1}^n (z \neq  x_i \land E(z,x_i) ) \land \bigwedge_{j = 1}^m (z \neq y_j \land \neg E(z, y_j)) \bigr ) \right )
$$

Let
$$
T_{RG} = T_G \cup \{ \exists x,y \: (x \neq y) \} \cup \{ \sigma_{n,m} : n, m \geq 1 \}
$$

::: {#exr-}
Show that every countable model of $T_{RG}$ is homogeneous.
:::

::: {#exr-}
Show that if $\mathcal{R}$ is a model of $T_{RG}$, $\operatorname{age}(\mathcal{R}) = \overline{K}$.
:::

It follows from Fraïssé's Theorem that $T_{RG}$ has a countable model $\mathcal{R}$, and that this model is unique up to isomorphism.

::: {#exr-}
Show that $T_{RG}$ is complete.
:::

$\mathcal{R}$ is called the **random graph** and $T_{RG}$ the *theory of the random graph*. Why? Let $G_N$ be the set of all simple graphs on the vertex set $\{1, \dots, N\}$. Put a probability distribution on $G_N$ by giving every graph the same probability. (Alternatively, we could independently assign edges to any vertex pair with probability $1/2$. This is called the **Erdös-Renyi model**.) Given an $\mathcal{L}_G$-sentence $\sigma$, let $\mathbb{P}_N(\sigma)$ be the probability that $\sigma$ holds for a random graph in $G_N$, i.e.

$$
\mathbb{P}_N(\sigma)=  \frac{|\{ \mathcal{G} \in G_N : \mathcal{G} \models \sigma\}|}{|G_N|}.
$$

It turns out, for large $N$, graphs will satisfy the extension axioms with high probability.

::: {#exr-asextension}
Show that for any $n, m \geq 1$, 

$$
\lim_{N \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_N(\sigma_{n,m}) = 1.
$$
:::

This justifies referring to $\mathcal{R}$ as *the random graph*, since it can be seen as the "limit" of finite random graphs.


## Further explorations

### 0-1 law for graphs

::: {#thm-zero-one}
For any $\mathcal{L}_G$-sentence $\sigma$,

$$
\text{either } \lim_{N \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_N(\sigma) = 0 \text{ or } \lim_{N \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_N(\sigma) = 1.
$$
Moreover, $T_{RG}$ axiomatizes the theory
$$
\{ \sigma : \lim_{N \to \infty} \mathbb{P}_N(\sigma) = 1 \} 
$$
and this theory is complete.
:::

*To prove the theorem, use that $T_{RG}$ is complete together with @exr-asextension. Give it a try!*


### Other Fraïssé classes

There are other classes of structures that are amalgamation classes, for example:

- finite fields of characteristic $p$
- finite groups
- (non-trivial) finite Boolean algebras 


*What kind of object is the Fraïssé limit in each case?*
