## Bounded Quantifiers

For terms $t$ and formulas $\varphi$ in the language of $\mathsf{PA}^-$, we write
$$
\begin{aligned}
\exists x < t \;  \varphi & \text{ for } & \exists x (x < t \wedge \varphi)\\
\forall x < t \;  \varphi & \text{ for } & \forall x (x < t \to \varphi)
\end{aligned}
$$
and call $\exists x < t$ and $\forall x < t$ **bounded quantifiers**.

## Arithmetical Hierarchy

## Definition

- $\varphi$ is a $\Delta_0$-formula: $\iff$ $\varphi$ contains at most bounded quantifiers,
- $\varphi$ is a $\Sigma_1$-formula: $\iff$ $\varphi = \exists \vec{x} \; \psi$ for a $\Delta_0$-formula $\psi$,
- $\varphi$ is a $\Pi_1$-formula: $\iff$ $\varphi = \forall \vec{x}  \;\psi$ for a $\Delta_0$-formula $\psi$.
:::

This is the beginning of the **arithmetical hierarchy**. Setting
$$
\Sigma_0 = \Pi_0 = \Delta_0,
$$
we can continue:

- $\varphi$ is a $\Sigma_{n+1}$-formula $\iff$ $\varphi = \exists \vec{x} \; \psi$ for a $\Pi_n$-formula $\psi$,
- $\varphi$ is a $\Pi_{n+1}$-formula $\iff$ $\varphi = \forall \vec{x} \; \psi$ for a $\Sigma_n$-formula $\psi$.

Thus, a $\Sigma_3$-formula has the form $\exists \vec{x} \; \forall \vec{y}\; \exists \vec{z} \; \psi$, where $\psi$ contains at most bounded quantifiers. This means that bounded quantifiers are not counted; $\Sigma$ or $\Pi$ indicates whether the formula begins with a (finite) sequence of $\exists$-quantifiers or $\forall$-quantifiers respectively, and the index counts the quantifier blocks. So it depends less on the number of quantifiers than on the number of quantifier alternations.

In this classification, we do not distinguish between logically equivalent formulas, so that every $\Pi_n$-formula for $n<m$ is also a $\Sigma_m$- and $\Pi_m$-formula (by simply prefixing the formula with additional quantifiers over variables that do not occur). Thus we can also define the formula sets
$$
\Delta_n = \Sigma_n \cap \Pi_n.
$$

This gives us the following picture of the **arithmetical hierarchy**:

```
         Δ₀ ─── Δ₁     Δ₂     Δ₃ ─── ...
               ╱  ╲   ╱  ╲   ╱  ╲
              ╱    ╲ ╱    ╲ ╱    ╲
            Σ₁    Π₁    Σ₂   Π₂    Σ₃   Π₃
```

Many useful properties of natural numbers can be expressed using $\Delta_0$-formulas, e.g.:
$$
x \text{ is irreducible} \iff 1 < x \wedge \forall u<x \; \forall v<x \; \neg (u \cdot v = x).
$$

We will show that the recursive relations coincide with the sets that can be defined by $\Delta_1$-formulas in the natural numbers, and that the graph of a recursive function can be defined by a $\Sigma_1$-formula in the natural numbers. We begin with the

## Lemma on $\Delta_0$-Formulas {#sec-delta0formeln}

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Lemma
*For every $\Delta_0$-formula $\theta(\vec{v})$, the relation*
$$
R(\vec{a}) \iff \mathbb{N} \models \theta(\vec{a})
$$
*is primitive recursive.*
:::

::: {.proof}
We show by induction on lz($\theta$) that the associated characteristic function
$$
c_{\theta}(\vec{x}) =
\begin{cases}
    1  &  \text{if } \mathbb{N} \models \theta(\vec{x})\\
    0   &   \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
is primitive recursive.

First, the functions $x+1, x+y, x \cdot y$ are p.r., and thus every term in $\mathbb{N}$ defines a primitive recursive function. Since the functions $\text{eq}(x,y)=\overline{\text{sg}}(|x-y|)$ and $\text{sg}(y \stackrel{.}{-} x)$ are also primitive recursive (and the p.r. functions are closed under composition), the claim holds for the atomic formulas $t=s, t < s$.

For the case of propositional operations, use
$$
c_{\neg \theta}(\vec{x}) = 1 \stackrel{.}{-} c_{\theta}(\vec{x}),  \; c_{\theta \wedge \psi}(\vec{x}) = c_{\theta}(\vec{x}) \cdot c_{\psi}(\vec{x}), \; c_{\theta \vee \psi}(\vec{x}) = \min(c_{\theta}(\vec{x}),c_{\psi}(\vec{x})).
$$

Finally, if $\theta$ is a $\Delta_0$-formula, $t$ is a term and $\psi(\vec{x}) = \forall y < t(\vec{x}) \; \theta(\vec{x},y)$, then the claim follows from
$$
c_{ \psi}(\vec{x}) = \text{eq}( t(\vec{x}) , (\mu y \le t(\vec{x}) (c_{\theta}(\vec{x},y) = 0)).
$$
One argues similarly in the case of the formula $\exists y < t(\vec{x}) \; \theta(\vec{x},y)$ (or reduces this case to the earlier one using negation).
:::

The converse of the above lemma does not hold: there are primitive recursive sets that cannot be defined by any $\Delta_0$-formula in the natural numbers.
