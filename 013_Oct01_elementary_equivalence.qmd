\
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be an arbitrary language. Show that for finite $\mathcal{L}$-structures $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$,

$$
\mathcal{M} \equiv mathcal{N} \; \iff \; \mathcal{M}) = \mathcal{N}
$$

(*We already know this for finite languages (since there a single sentence suffices to force isomorphism). How can we extend this to arbitrary languages?*)

\
Show that for any two $\mathcal{L}$-structures $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$,
$$
\mathcal{M}\equiv \mathcal{N} \; \iff \; \operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{M}) = \operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{N}).
$$

Deduce that a theory $T$ is complete iff any two models are elementary equivalent.

Let $\operatorname{DLO}$ be the theory of *dense linear orders without endpoints* (i.e. no minimal or maximal element).

Find a finite axiomatization of $\operatorname{DLO}$.

Show that any two countable models of $\operatorname{DLO}$ of the same cardinality are isomorphic.
