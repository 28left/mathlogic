# Completing Theories

## Key Concepts

- An $\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ is a **Henkin theory** if for every sentence of the form $\exists x \psi$ there exists a constant $\mathcal{L}$-term $t$ such that 
$$
    T \vdash_{\mathcal{L}} \exists x \psi \; \to \; \psi_{t/x}
$$

- **Questions:**

    - What are Henkin theories needed for?
    - Do they exist? 
    - Can we extend a given consistent theory to a Henkin theory that is still consistent?



## Problems


:::{#exr-}
\
As before, let $\mathcal{A}_T$ be the term model of $T$. Pinpoint exactly where we might run into difficulties when we are trying to prove
$$
\mathcal{A}_T \models \exists x \psi \; \iff \; T \vdash_{\mathcal{L}} \exists x \psi
$$

## Interlude
\
What if in $\exists x \psi$ the variable $x$ is not free? Does that make a difference regarding being a Henkin theory?

\
Can you find examples of a Henkin theories (without needing to extend the lenaguage)?

The basic construction step for extending an $\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ to a Henkin theory is for every sentence of the form $\sigma \equiv \exists x \psi$,

- add a new constant symbol $c_\sigma$ to $\mathcal{L}$
- add the formula $\exists x \psi \; \to \; \psi_{c_\sigma/x}$ to $T$.
