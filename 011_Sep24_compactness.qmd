# The Compactness Theorem

## Key Concepts

- **Theorem:** A theory $T$ has a model if and only if every finite subtheory $T_0 \subseteq T$ has a model.

## Problems

::: {#exr-}
\
Let $X$ be the set of all maximally consistent $\mathcal{L}$-theories. Recall that the sets
$$\langle \sigma \rangle = \{ T \in X \colon \sigma \in T\} \quad (\sigma \text{ $\mathcal{L}$-sentence})$$
generate a Hausdorff topology on $X$. 

Show that the topology is compact.

:::{#exr-}
\
One can use the compactness theorem to construct non-standard models of arithmetic, i.e., models of $\operatorname{Th}(\mathbb{N}, 0, 1, +, \cdot, <)$ not isomorphic to $\mathbb{N}$.

Use the same technique for $\operatorname{Th}(\mathbb{R}, \{c_a : a \in \mathbb{R}\}, +, \cdot, <)$, where for every $a \in \mathbb{R}$ we add a constant symbol $c_a$ to the language? What kind of structure do we obtain? Discuss.

## Take-home Problem
\
Use the compactness theorem to show (without using the Axiom of Choice) that every set can be linearly ordered.

Try to trengthen this to:

> Every partial order can be extended to a linear order.
