# Consistency and Completeness

## Key Concepts

- **Consistency**: \
A theory $T$ is **consistent**  if there does not exist a formula $\psi$ such that $T \vdash \psi$ and $T \vdash \neg \psi$.

- **Completeness**: \
A theory $T$ is **complete** if it is consistent and for every sentence $\sigma$, $T \vdash \sigma$ or $T \vdash \neg \sigma$. 

- In a complete theory, every statement is determined, in the sense that is either true or false in the theory.

- An important example of a complete theory is the *theory of a fixed structure* $\mathcal{M}$,

$$\operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{M}) = \{ \sigma \colon \mathcal{M} \models \sigma \}$$

- If, on the other hand, we are given a complete theory $T$, does $T$ have a model? This is the subject of the **Completeness Theorem**. It actually shows that any *consistent* theory has a model.



## Problems

\
Prove the *Soundness Theorem*, i.e. show that

$$T \vdash \varphi \; \Rightarrow \; T \models \varphi$$

\
Why is the theory of a structure, $\operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{M})$, indeed a complete theory?

::: {#exr-}
\
Show that a theory $T$ is inconsistent iff for every formula $\psi$, $T \vdash \psi$
:::


::: {#exr-}
\
For each of the following classes $\mathbf{K}$ of structures, determine whether they are *axiomatizable*, i.e. whether there exists a theory $T$ (in the language of the structures) such that

$$\mathbf{K} = \{ \mathcal{M} \colon \mathcal{M} \models T \}$$

(In this case $K$ is also called *elementary*.)

If $\mathbf{K}$ is axiomatizable, discuss whether it is actually *finitely axiomatizable* (i.e. can $T$ be chosen finite).
And is $T$ complete?

- $\mathbf{K} =$ Abelian groups
- $\mathbf{K} =$ infinite sets
- $\mathbf{K} =$ fields of characteristic $p$ ($p$ prime)
- $\mathbf{K} =$ bipartite graphs
- $\mathbf{K} =$ torsion groups  (*all elements have finite order*)
- $\mathbf{K} =$ algebraically closed fields of characteristic $0$

(*Note: We do not yet have the tools to rigorously answer all these questions, but try an "educated" guess.*)

\
Suppose that $T \cup \{\neg\varphi\}$ is inconsistent. Show that $T \vdash \varphi$. 

(*This is a
technical formulation of the legitimacy of proofs by contradiction.*)
