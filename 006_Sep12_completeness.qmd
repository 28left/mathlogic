# Consistency and Completeness

## Key Concepts

- **Consistency**: \
A theory $T$ is **consistent**  if there does not exist a formula $\psi$ such that $T \vdash \psi$ and $T \vdash \neg \psi$.

- **Completeness**: \
A theory $T$ is **complete** if it is consistent and for every sentence $\sigma$, $T \vdash \sigma$ or $T \vdash \neg \sigma$. 

- In a complete theory, every statement is determined, in the sense that is either true or false in the theory.

- An important example of a complete theory is the *theory of a fixed structure* $\mathcal{M}$,

$$\operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{M}) = \{ \sigma \colon \mathcal{M} \models \sigma \}$$

- If on the other hand, we are given a complete theory $T$, does $T$ have a model? This is the subject of the **Completeness Theorem**. It actually shows that any *consistent* theory has a model.



## Problems

## Carry-over from Sep 10
\
Prove the *Soundness Theorem*, i.e. show that

$$T \vdash \varphi \; \Rightarrow \; T \models \varphi$$

\
Show that a theory $T$ is inconsistent iff for every formula $\psi$, $T \vdash \psi$

## Formal notion of proof -- Warmup
\
Verify that

$$\{\varphi, \neg \psi\} \vdash \neg(\varphi \to \psi)$$
:::



:::{#exr-}
\
Argue (semantically) that if $x$ is not free in $\psi$,

$$\{\varphi \to \psi\} \models \exists x \varphi \: \to \: \psi$$

Then prove this *syntactically*, i.e. show (under the same assumption) that

$$\{\varphi \to \psi\} \vdash \exists x \varphi \: \to \: \psi$$
:::






:::{.callout-important}
## Take-home problem
\
Show that 

\begin{align*}
\{\varphi \to \psi \} & \vdash \exists x \varphi \: \to \: \exists x \psi \\
\{\varphi \to \psi \} & \vdash \forall x \varphi \: \to \: \forall x \psi \\
\end{align*}
