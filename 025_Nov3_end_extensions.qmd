# End Extensions {#end-extensions}

The standard model can be embedded into every model $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathsf{PA}$ as an initial segment.
It turns out this already holds for models of the theory $\mathsf{PA}^-$.

::: Definition

Let $L$ be a language containing a 2-ary symbol $<$, and let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be $L$-structures with $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$. Then $\mathcal{N}$ is called an **end extension** of $\mathcal{M}$ (and correspondingly $\mathcal{M}$ is an **initial segment** of $\mathcal{N}$) if and only if the larger set $N$ does not add any further elements below an element of $M$:
$$
\mathcal{M} \subseteq_{end} \mathcal{N}: \iff \text{for all} \; x \in M,y \in N: (y<^N x \Rightarrow y \in M).
$$
:::

Each natural number $n$ is represented in the standard model, which we also simply denote by $\mathbb{N}$ here, by the constant term
$$
\underline{n} = 1+ \ldots + 1 \quad \text{($n$ times)}
$$
where $\underline{0}$ is the constant $0$.


::: Theorem
Let $\mathcal{M} \models \mathsf{PA}^-$. Then the map
$$n \mapsto \underline{n}^{\mathcal{M}}$$
defines an embedding of the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ onto an initial segment of $\mathcal{M}$.

In particular, every model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$ is isomorphic to an end extension of the standard model $\mathbb{N}$.*

::: {.proof}
By simple induction (in the meta-theory), one shows for all natural numbers $n,k,l$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
n = k+l & \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \underline{n}= \underline{k}+ \underline{l} \\
n = k \cdot l & \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \underline{n}= \underline{k} \cdot \underline{l} \\
n < k& \quad \Longrightarrow \quad  \mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \underline{n} < \underline{k}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
\mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \forall x \; (\; x \le  \underline{k} \to  x = \underline{0} \; \vee \ldots \vee \; x = \underline{k})
$$

The first three statements will later be generalized to all recursive functions and relations; they imply that the map $n \mapsto \underline{n}^{\mathcal{M}}$ is a homomorphism, and, due to the last statement, the map is also an embedding onto an initial segment of $\mathcal{M}$.

### Remark

The standard model has no proper initial segment, and $\mathbb{Z}[X]^+$ has $\mathbb{N}$ as its only proper initial segment. On the other hand, every model $\mathcal{M} \models \mathsf{PA}^-$ has a proper end extension that is also a model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$, namely the non-negative part of the polynomial ring $R[X]$, where $R$ is the discretely ordered ring associated with the model $\mathcal{M}$.
