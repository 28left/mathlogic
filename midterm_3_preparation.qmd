title: "MATH 557 Midterm 3 Preparation"
---

The third midterm will have two parts:

1. Reproduce a proof (in sufficient detail) of one the theorems below we covered in class.
2. Present a proof to one of the exercises (or a closely related problem) listed on this page.

## Theorems

::: Theorem

Any two countable models of $\operatorname{DLO}$ are isomorphic.
:::

::: Theorem

Suppose for $\mathcal{L}$-theories $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{N}$, $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$ and for any formula $\psi(x, \vec{y})$ and any $\vec{a} \in M$, if there exists $b \in N$ such that $\mathcal{N} \models \psi[b, \vec{a}]$, then there also exists $c \in M$ such that $\mathcal{N} \models \psi[c, \vec{a}]$. Then $\mathcal{M} \preceq \mathcal{N}$.
:::


::: Theorem

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an $\mathcal{L}$-structure, $\kappa$ an infinite cardinal with $\operatorname{card}(\mathcal{L}) \le \kappa$ and $\kappa \le \operatorname{card}(A)$. Then there exists a structure $\mathcal{B}$ with
$$
\mathcal{B} \preceq  \mathcal{A} \; , \; \operatorname{card}(B) = \kappa.
$$
:::


::: Theorem

Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an infinite $\mathcal{L}$-structure, $\kappa$ a cardinal with $\operatorname{card}(\mathcal{L}) \le \kappa$ and $\operatorname{card}(A) \le \kappa$. Then there exists a structure $\mathcal{B}$ with
$$
\mathcal{A} \preceq  \mathcal{B} \; , \;  \operatorname{card}(B) = \kappa.
$$
:::

::: Theorem 

Suppose $T$ is a consistent $\mathcal{L}$-theory with no finite models. If $T$ is $\kappa$-categorical for some $\kappa \geq |\mathcal{L}|$, then $T$ is complete.
:::


::: Theorem

Let $\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{U} = \prod_{i \in I} \mathcal{M}_i / \mathcal{U}$ be an ultraproduct.
For every $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\varphi(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ and tuples  
$\vec a \in \prod_{i \in I} M_i$,
$$
\mathcal{M}/\mathcal{U} \models \varphi[\vec a_{\mathcal{U}}]
\iff
\{\, i \in I : \mathcal{M}_i \models \varphi[\vec a_i]\,\} \in \mathcal{U}.
$$
:::


::: Theorem

Any two countable homogeneous structures with the same age are isomorphic.
:::

<!-- ::: Theorem

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be a finite language with only relation symbols. Let $\overline{K}$ be a class of finite $\mathcal{L}$-structures such that there are only countably many isomorphism types in $\overline{K}$.

Then $\overline{K}$ is an amalgamation class if and only if $\overline{K}$ is the age of a countable homogeneous $\mathcal{L}$-structure.

## Problems


::: Problem

Show that the functions 
$$
\operatorname{rem}(x,y) = \text{remainder when $y$ is divided by $x$}
$$
(put $\operatorname{rem}(0,y) = y$ to  make it total) and 
$$
\operatorname{qt}(x,y) = \text{quotient when $y$ is divided by $x$}
$$
(put $\operatorname{qt}(0,y) = 0$) are primitive recursive.

In other words, show that the uniquely determined functions (for $x \geq 1$) satisfying
$$
y = \operatorname{qt}(x,y) \cdot x + \operatorname{rem}(x,y) \qquad 0 \leq \operatorname{rem}(x,y) < x
$$
are primitive recursive. 

You may can use that the functions
$x+y$, $x\cdot y$, $\max(x,y)$, $\min(x,y)$, $|x-y|$, $x \dot{-} y$, $\operatorname{sg}(x)$, $\bar{\operatorname{sg}}(x)$ are primitive recursive. 
:::


In the following, $\mathcal{L}_A = \{0,1,+,\cdot, <\}$ denotes the language of $\mathsf{PA}^-$.



::: Problem

A model $\mathcal{M}$ of an $\mathcal{L}$-theory $T$ is **prime** if for every $\mathcal{N} \models T$, there exists an elementary embedding of $\mathcal{M}$ into $\mathcal{N}$.

- Show that $\mathbb{N}$ is a prime model of $\operatorname{Th}(\mathbb{N},+,\cdot, 0, 1)$.
- Show that if $T$ is an $\omega$-categorical theory over a countable language and has no finite models, $T$ has a prime model.
:::


::: Problem

 We say an $\mathcal{L}_A$-theory $T'$ is a *finite extension* of an $\mathcal{L}_A$-theory $T$ if $T' \supseteq T$ and $T' \setminus T$ is finite.

Show that if $T$ is decidable and $T'$ is a finite extension of $T$, then $T'$ is decidable.
:::



::: Problem

Let $\mathcal{L}$ be the empty language, i.e. the atomic formulas are of the form $x=y$, where $x,y$ are variables.
Let $T$ be the theory that says that there are at most two distinct elements:

$$
\exist x, y \forall z ( z = x \lor z = x)
$$

Show that $T$ is incomplete but decidable. For decidability, it suffices to give an informal argument and invoke the Church-Turing Thesis.

(*Hint: There are, up to isomorphism, just two models of $T$. Show that for each of the two models, you can decide whether an $\mathcal{L}$-sentence holds in it.*)
:::


::: Problem

An $\mathcal{L}_A$-structure $\mathcal{A}$ is *strongly undecidable* if every $\mathcal{L}_A$-theory $T$ with $\mathcal{A} \models T$ is undecidable.
