## Key Concepts

- **$\mathcal{L}$-structures**: Provide a realm to interpret $\mathcal{L}$-formulas over. 
    - non-empty universe $M$,
    - interpretation of all constant, function, and relation symbols over $M$.

- **structure isomorphism**: bijection $\pi$ between the universes of two $\mathcal{L}$-structures that preserves interpretations of symbols. General version of the well-known idea of isomorphism of mathematical structures.

- **assignment**: function $\alpha: \mathcal{V} \to M$ that assigns all variables values in the universe of a structure. Recursively extends to terms.

- **satisfaction**: $\mathcal{M} \models \varphi[\alpha]$ means the $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\varphi$ is true when interpreted in the $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\mathcal{M}$ and all variables are assigned values according to assignment $\alpha$. This is defined recursively over the structure of a formula.





# Problems

::: {#exr-}
\
The set of $\cal{L}$-terms $\mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{L}}$ is defined as the *smallest* set (with respect to $\subseteq$) containing variables and constant symbols and that is closed under function symbol application.

- Why do this set exist?

- Does a similar argument work for the set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas?

- Find an example of a (non-empty) family of sets and a property $P$ (applicable to the sets in the family) such that a $\subseteq$-smallest set with property $P$ does not exist.

Prove the **Readbility Lemma**: For any term $t$, exactly one of the following holds.

1. There exists a $v \in \mathcal{V}$ such that $t \equiv v$.

2. There exists a $c \in \mathcal{C}^{\mathcal{L}}$ such that $t \equiv c$.

3. There exists a number $n \in \mathbb{N}$, a function symbol $f
   \in F_n^{\mathcal{L}}$, and terms $t_1,
   \dots, t_n$ such that $t \equiv ft_1\dots t_n$.

Show that no proper initial segment of a term is a term.
(*Use induction on the length of a term.*)

Deduce **unique readability**: The decomposition in (3.) above is unique.

Let $n$ be a natural number and let +L be any language. Find formulas $, \psi^{\geq}, \psi^{\leq}, \psi^=$ such that, for any +L-structure $\mathcal{M}$,

\begin{align}
\mathcal{M} \models \psi^{\geq} & \iff \; |M| \geq n \\
\mathcal{M} \models \psi^{\leq} & \iff \; |M| \leq n \\
\mathcal{M} \models \psi^{=} & \iff \; |M| = n \\
\end{align}

Let $\mathcal{L} = \{\cdot , e\}$ be the language of groups. Show that
there is a sentence $\varphi$ such that $\mathcal{M} \models \varphi$ if and only if $M \cong \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\times \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$.
