# The Model Existence Theorem

## Key Concepts

- Extend $T$ to a Henkin theory $T_H$, then complete it to a theory $T'$.

- $T'$ is a complete Henkin theory for the extended language $\mathcal{L}_H$.

- For $T'$, its term model $\mathcal{A}_{T'}$ satisfies
$$
\mathcal{A}_{T'} \models \sigma \; \iff \; T' \vdash_{\mathcal{L}_H} \sigma
$$
for all $\mathcal{L}_H$-sentences $\sigma$.

## Problems


:::{#exr-}
\
How do we obtain a model for $T$ from a model for $T'$?

\
Why is $\mathcal{A}_{T'}$ countable if $\mathcal{L}$ is countable?
:::


::: {#exr-}
\
Let $X$ be the set of all maximally consistent $\mathcal{L}$-theories. Recall that the sets
$$\langle \sigma \rangle = \{ T \in X \colon \sigma \in T\} \quad (\sigma \text{ $\mathcal{L}$-sentence})$$
generate a Hausdorff topology on $X$. 

Show that the topology is compact.
