## Take-home Problem 1
\
Prove unique readability for the set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas.
:::

::: {#sol-1}
\
**First** prove **readibility**, i.e. the statement that for any $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\varphi$, exactly one of the following cases holds:

(1) There exist terms $s,t$ such that $\varphi \equiv s=t$.
(2) There exists a relation symbol $R$ and, if $n$ is the arity of $R$, terms $t_1, \dots, t_n$ sucht that $\varphi \equiv Rt_1\dots t_n$.
(3) There exists a formula $\psi$ such that $\varphi \equiv \neg \psi$.
(4) There exist formulas $\psi, \theta$ such that $\varphi \equiv (\psi \land \theta)$.
(5) There exists a variable $x$ and a formula $\psi$ such that $\varphi \equiv \exists x \psi$.

To see this, let $F$ be the subset of $\mathcal{L}^*$ such that every $\theta \in F$ satisfies exactly one of (1)-(5). Then $F$ contains all atomic formulas and is closed under $\neg, \land, \exists x$. Since the set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas is the smallest such set, it follows that every $\mathcal{L}$-formula is contained in $F$, and therefore has the desired property.


**Second** we argue that a proper initial segment of a formula cannot be a formula. We proceed by induction on the length $l$ of $\varphi$. For $l=1$ there is no formula of that length. Now suppose $\varphi$ is a formula of length $l+1$, and $\beta$ is a proper initial segment. We may assume $\beta$ is not empty. We consider theses (1)-(5) from readability.

Case $\varphi \equiv s=t$
: Either $\beta \equiv s = t'$ with $t \subset t'$, but this would contradict that no proper initial segment of a term is a term. Or $\beta \equiv s=$: An easy induction over the length of a formula shows that no formula ends with $=$. Or $\beta \subseteq s$. Another easy induction shows that no formula can be a term or an initial segment of a term.

Case $\varphi \equiv Rt_1\dots t_n$
: If $\beta$ were a formula, it has to be of the form $Rs_1\dots s_n$. Comparing terms, we would see that one of the $s_i$ is a proper initial segment of some $t_j$, which is impossible.

Case $\varphi \equiv \neg \theta$
: Then $\beta \equiv \neg \beta'$ with $\beta'$ a proper initial segment of $\theta$. By inductive hypothesis, $\beta'$ is not a formula, hence $\neg \beta'$ is not a formula either.

Case $\varphi \equiv (\psi \land \theta)$
: Then $\beta$ starts with $($ but does not end with $)$. Another induction shows that for any formula, the number of $($'s always equals the number of $)$'s.

Case $\varphi \equiv \exists x \varphi$
: Neither '$\exists$' nor '$\exists x$' are formulas. If $\beta$ is longer than that, it is of the form $\exists x \beta'$. By inductive hypothesis, $\beta'$ is not a formula, and hence $\beta$ is not a formula (by readability).


**Finally**, we prove **unique readability**: The choices in (1)-(5) are unique.

Case (1)
: Suppose $\varphi \equiv s=t \equiv s'=t'$. Since no proper initial segment of a term is a term, it must hold that $s\equiv s'$ and $t \equiv t'$.

Case (2)
: Suppose $\varphi \equiv Rt_1\dots t_n \equiv S s_1\dots s_k$. Then $R \equiv S$ and $n=k$. Comparing terms inductively, using again the fact that no proper initial segment of a term is a term, we get $s_i \equiv t_i$ for all $i$.

Case (3)
: Suppose $\varphi \equiv \neg \psi \equiv \neg \theta$. Immediately, we infer $\psi \equiv \theta$.

Case (4)
: Suppose $\varphi \equiv (\psi_1 \land \theta_1) \equiv (\psi_2\land \theta_2)$. Assume $\psi_1 \nequiv \psi_2$. Then $\psi_1$ is a proper initial segment of $\psi_2$ or vice versa (since both of them are part of $\varphi$). Either case is impossible due to the fact that no proper initial segment of a formula is a formula. Hence $\psi_1 \equiv \psi_2$ and thus also $\theta_1 \equiv \theta_2$.

Case (5)
: Suppose $\varphi \equiv \exists x \psi \equiv \exists y \theta$. By comparing entries, we get $x \equiv y$ and thus \psi \equiv \theta$, as desired.

Give an example of a language $\mathcal{L}$ and an $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\psi$ such that

- there is at least one $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\cal A$ such that $\cal A \models \psi$,
- for all $\cal L$-structures $\cal A$, if $\cal A \models \psi$, then the universe $A$ of $\cal A$ is infinite.

\
Use the compactness theorem to show (without using the Axiom of Choice) that every set can be linearly ordered.

Try to strengthen this to:

> Every partial order can be extended to a linear order.
