## Take-home Problem
\
Prove **unique readability** for the set of $\mathcal{L}$-formulas.

## Take-home Problem
\
Let $\mathcal{L}$ be any finite language and let $\mathcal{M}$ be a finite $\mathcal{L}$-structure. Show
that there is an $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\varphi$ such that 
$$
\mathcal{N} \models \varphi \; \iff \; \mathcal{N} \cong \mathcal{M}.
$$

## Take-home Problem
\
Give an example of a language $\mathcal{L}$ and an $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\psi$ such that

- there is at least one $\mathcal{L}$-structure $\cal A$ such that $\cal A \models \psi$,
- for all $\cal L$-structures $\cal A$, if $\cal A \models \psi$, then the universe $A$ of $\cal A$ is infinite.

\
Show that 

\begin{align*}
\{\varphi \to \psi \} & \vdash \exists x \varphi \: \to \: \exists x \psi \\
\{\varphi \to \psi \} & \vdash \forall x \varphi \: \to \: \forall x \psi \\
\end{align*}

## Take-home Problem
\
Show that for every $\mathcal{L}$-formula $\varphi$,
$$
T_H \vdash_{\mathcal{L}_H} \varphi \; \iff \; T \vdash_{\mathcal{L}} \varphi
$$

\
Use the compactness theorem to show (without using the Axiom of Choice) that every set can be linearly ordered.

Try to trengthen this to:

> Every partial order can be extended to a linear order.
