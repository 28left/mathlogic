# Peano Arithmetic

While the algebraic theories of groups, rings, fields, ... have many models, (elementary) number theory studies properties of *one* model, which is called the **standard model** of number theory:

$$
\mathcal{N} = (\mathbb{N},+,\cdot,+1,0).
$$

Let $\mathcal{L}_{\mathsf{PA}}$ be the associated language, for which we also choose $+,\cdot,0$ as (non-logical) symbols, but $S$ for the unary successor operation $+1$. The theory of the standard model, $\operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{N})$, is the set of $L_{\mathsf{PA}}$-sentences that hold in this model. We have already seen as a consequence of the compactness theorem that there exist **non-standard models**, i.e., models that are not isomorphic to the standard model, because they have "infinitely large" numbers. 

Moreover, $\operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{N})$ as a theory, while complete, is rather mysterious, since we do not know a priori which sentences exactly it comprises. The most important properties of the standard model are captured by the **Peano Axioms**.


::: Definition
## Peano Axioms

**P1.** $Sx \ne 0$

**P2.** $Sx=Sy \to x=y$

**P3.** $x+0 = x$

**P4.** $x+Sy =S(x+y)$

**P5.** $x \cdot 0 = 0$

**P6.** $x \cdot Sy = x \cdot y + x$

To these we add the infinitely many **induction axioms**:

**Ind.** $\varphi(0) \, \wedge \, \forall x (\varphi(x) \to \varphi(Sx)) \to \forall x \; \varphi(x)$
:::

The theory comprising these axioms is called $\mathsf{PA}$, **Peano Arithmetic**. As every model of $\operatorname{Th}(\mathcal{N})$ is also a model of $\mathsf{PA}$, it follows from the compactness theorem that there are non-standard models of $\mathsf{PA}$.
 

::: Theorem
There exists a (countable) model $\mathcal{N}^*$ of $\mathsf{PA}$ which is not isomorphic to $\mathcal{N}$.
:::

(In fact, we know by Loewenheim-Skolem that there exists a non-standard model in every infinite cardinality.)

These results can be interpreted as an expressive weakness of the language of first-order logic, because if one moves to a **language of second order**, in which one additionally has the possibility of using **second-order quantifiers** $\exists X, \forall Y$ to quantify over subsets of the respective domain, then one can uniquely characterize (up to isomorphism) the standard model in this stronger theory:

::: Definition 
## Second-Order Peano Axioms

The theory $\mathsf{PA}^{(2)}$ (Peano Axioms of second order) has the following axioms:

**P1.** $\forall x \; 0 \ne Sx$

**P2.** $\forall x \forall y (Sx = Sy \to x = y)$

**IND.** $\forall X (0 \in X \wedge \forall x ( x \in X \to Sx \in X) \to \forall x \; x \in X)$
:::

::: Theorem
*Every model of $\mathsf{PA}^{(2)}$ is isomorphic to the standard model* $(\mathbb{N},S,0)$.
:::

The second-order induction axiom (actually a *set-theoretic* axiom) is thus significantly more expressive than the corresponding induction schema, in which only first-order properties are allowed, which can only quantify over elements (instead of also over subsets) of natural numbers.

On the other hand, second-order logic has other disadvantages â€“ most prominently, no completeness theorem holds.


## $\mathsf{PA}^-$: Peano Arithmetic without Induction

$\mathsf{PA}$ still has infinitely many (induction) axioms. We will introduce a finite subtheory that turns out is strong enough to capture many essential properties of arithmetic.

This theory is formalized in a language $\mathcal{L}$ with the symbols $0,1,<,+, \cdot$. The first axioms state that addition and multiplication are associative and commutative and satisfy the distributive law, and furthermore that 0 and 1 are neutral elements for the respective operations and 0 is a zero divisor:

**Axioms A1-A7:**

- **A1:** $(x +y)+z= x + (y+z)$
- **A2:** $(x \cdot y) \cdot z= x \cdot (y \cdot z)$
- **A3:** $x + y= y + x$
- **A4:** $x \cdot y = y \cdot x$
- **A5:** $x \cdot (y+z) = x \cdot y + x \cdot z$
- **A6:** $x+0=x \wedge x \cdot 0 = 0$
- **A7:** $x \cdot 1 = x$

Here we use the usual algebraic bracket conventions ($\cdot$ binds more strongly than $+$). For the $<$-relation, the axioms state that it is a linear order compatible with addition and multiplication:

**Axioms A8-A12:**

- **A8:** $\neg  \; x < x$
- **A9:** $x < y \wedge  y < z \to x < z$
- **A10:** $x < y \vee x = y \vee y < x$
- **A11:** $x < y \to x+z < y+z$
- **A12:** $0 < z \wedge x < y \to x \cdot z <  y \cdot z$

A number can be subtracted from a larger one:

**Axiom A13:**

- **A13:** $x < y \to \exists z \; (x+z = y)$

And finally, $1$ is the successor of $0$ and $0$ is the smallest element (where as usual $x \le y: \iff x < y \vee x = y$):

**Axioms A14-A15:**

- **A14:** $0<1 \wedge \forall x \; (0 < x \to 1 \le x)$
- **A15:** $\forall x \; (0 \le x)$

From A14 it follows with A11 that more generally $x+1$ is the successor of $x$, and thus the order is *discrete*:
$$
x < x+1 \wedge \forall y \; (x < y \to x+1 \le y).
$$

### Examples

1. In Peano Arithmetic $\mathsf{PA}$, one can define the $<$-relation by $x<y \leftrightarrow \exists z \; (x+z+1 = y)$ and thus obtain all axioms of $\mathsf{PA}^-$. In particular, the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ with the usual $<$-relation, the usual operations, and the natural numbers 0,1 is a model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$.

2. The set $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ of polynomials in one variable $X$ with integer coefficients is a commutative ring with the usual operations. One can order this ring by setting for a polynomial $p=a_n X^n+\ldots a_1 X + a_0$ with leading coefficient $a_n \ne 0$:
   $$
   a_n X^n+\ldots a_1 X + a_0 > 0 :\iff a_n>0
   $$
and thus ordering polynomials $p,q \in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ by $p<q: \iff q-p>0$.
The subset $\mathbb{Z}[X]^+$ of polynomials $p\in \mathbb{Z}[X]$ with $p\ge 0$ then becomes a model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$, in which the polynomial $X$ is larger than all constant polynomials and thus "infinitely large".


### Relation to Discretely Ordered Rings

In a ring, there is a group with respect to addition, while A13 only allows a restricted inverse formation. If one replaces axioms A13 and A15 in $\mathsf{PA}^-$ with the axiom

**Axiom A16:**

- **A16:** $\forall x \; \exists z \; (x+z = 0)$

one obtains the algebraic theory **DOR** of **discretely ordered rings**, whose models include, for example, the rings $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}[X]$. Every model $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathsf{PA}^-$ can be extended to a model $\mathcal{R}$ of the theory **DOR** (following the same pattern by which one extends the natural numbers to the ring of integers), such that the non-negative elements of $\mathcal{R}$ coincide with the original model. Conversely, for every model $\mathcal{R}$ of the theory **DOR**, the restriction to the non-negative elements is a model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$, so that one can *describe $\mathsf{PA}^-$ as the theory of (the non-negative part of) discretely ordered rings*.




## End Extensions {#end-extensions}

The standard model can be embedded into every model $\mathcal{M}$ of $\mathsf{PA}$ as an initial segment.
It turns out this already holds for models of the theory $\mathsf{PA}^-$.

::: Definition

Let $L$ be a language containing a 2-ary symbol $<$, and let $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{N}$ be $L$-structures with $\mathcal{M} \subseteq \mathcal{N}$. Then $\mathcal{N}$ is called an **end extension** of $\mathcal{M}$ (and correspondingly $\mathcal{M}$ is an **initial segment** of $\mathcal{N}$) if and only if the larger set $N$ does not add any further elements below an element of $M$:
$$
\mathcal{M} \subseteq_{end} \mathcal{N}: \iff \text{for all} \; x \in M,y \in N: (y<^N x \Rightarrow y \in M).
$$
:::

Each natural number $n$ is represented in the standard model, which we also simply denote by $\mathbb{N}$ here, by the constant term
$$
\underline{n} = 1+ \ldots + 1 \quad \text{($n$ times)}
$$
where $\underline{0}$ is the constant $0$.


::: Theorem
Let $\mathcal{M} \models \mathsf{PA}^-$. Then the map
$$n \mapsto \underline{n}^{\mathcal{M}}$$
defines an embedding of the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ onto an initial segment of $\mathcal{M}$.

In particular, every model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$ is isomorphic to an end extension of the standard model $\mathbb{N}$.*
:::

::: {.proof}
By simple induction (in the meta-theory), one shows for all natural numbers $n,k,l$:
$$
\begin{aligned}
n = k+l & \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \underline{n}= \underline{k}+ \underline{l} \\
n = k \cdot l & \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \underline{n}= \underline{k} \cdot \underline{l} \\
n < k& \quad \Longrightarrow \quad  \mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \underline{n} < \underline{k}\\
\end{aligned}
$$
and
$$
\mathsf{PA}^- \vdash \forall x \; (\; x \le  \underline{k} \to  x = \underline{0} \; \vee \ldots \vee \; x = \underline{k})
$$

The first three statements will later be generalized to all recursive functions and relations; They imply that the map $n \mapsto \underline{n}^{\mathcal{M}}$ is a homomorphism, and, due to the last statement, the map is also an embedding onto an initial segment of $\mathcal{M}$.
:::

### Remark

The standard model has no proper initial segment, and $\mathbb{Z}[X]^+$ has $\mathbb{N}$ as its only proper initial segment. On the other hand, every model $\mathcal{M} \models \mathsf{PA}^-$ has a proper end extension that is also a model of $\mathsf{PA}^-$, namely the non-negative part of the polynomial ring $R[X]$, where $R$ is the discretely ordered ring associated with the model $\mathcal{M}$.
