# Completing Theories

## Key Concepts

- We previously defined the *term model* $\mathcal{A}$. It holds that for any *atomic* sentence $\sigma$, 
$$\mathcal{A} \models \sigma \quad \iff \quad T \vdash \sigma$$



## Problems


:::{#exr-}
\
Verify that indeed for all atomic sentences $\sigma$,
$$\mathcal{A} \models \sigma \quad \iff \quad T \vdash \sigma$$
:::

::: {#exr-}
\
Recall that a theory $T$ is *maximally consistent* if it is consistent but does not have any consistent proper extensions. $T$ is called *deductively closed* if the deductive closure of $T$,
$$T^{\vdash} = \{ \sigma : T \vdash \sigma \}$$
is equal to $T$.

- Show that a maximally consistent theory is complete and deductively closed.
- Show that if $T$ is complete, then $T^{\vdash}$
is maximally consistent.

\
Is every consistent, deductively closed theory complete?

::: {#exr-}
\
Show that the union of an increasing sequence of consistent theories is consistent.

::: {#exr-}
\
Extend Lindebaum's theorem on the existence of maximally consistent extension from countable to arbitrary languages.
:::


::: {#exr-}
\
Fix a language $\mathcal{L}$. Let $X$ be the set of all maximally consistent $\mathcal{L}$-theories. For an $\mathcal{L}$-sentence $\sigma$, let 
$$\langle \sigma \rangle = \{ T \in X \colon \sigma \in T\}$$

Show that

- $\langle \sigma \land \tau \rangle = \langle \sigma \rangle \cap \langle \tau \rangle$
- $\langle \neg\sigma = X \setminus \langle \sigma \rangle$
:::

::: {#exr-}
\
Continuing the previous exercise, let $\mathcal{O}$ be the topology generated by the sets $\langle \sigma \rangle$. Show that

- each $\langle \sigma \rangle$ is clopen,
- the $\langle \sigma \rangle$ form a basis for $\mathcal{O}$,
- $\mathcal{O}$ is Hausdorff.
