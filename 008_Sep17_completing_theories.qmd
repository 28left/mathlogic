# Completing Theories

## Key Concepts

- We previously defined the *term model* $\mathcal{A}$. It holds that for any *atomic* sentence $\sigma$, 
$$\mathcal{A} \models \sigma \quad \iff \quad T \vdash \sigma$$



## Problems


:::{#exr-}
\
Verify that indeed for all atomic sentences $\sigma$,
$$\mathcal{A} \models \sigma \quad \iff \quad T \vdash \sigma$$

::: {#exr-}
\
Recall that a theory $T$ is *maximally consistent* if it is consistent but does not have any consistent proper extensions.

- Show that a maximally consistent theory is complete.
- Show that if $T$ is complete, its *deductive closure*
$$T^{\vdash} = \{ \sigma : T \vdash \sigma \}$$
is maximally consistent.

\
Show that the union of an increasing sequence of consistent theories is consistent.

::: {#exr-}
\
Extend Lindebaum's theorem on the existence of maximally consistent extension from countable to arbitrary languages.
